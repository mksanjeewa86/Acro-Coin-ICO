# Project: Acro Coin ICO
â€‹
In this project you're going to create your token and ICO. In doing so you will:
â€‹
- Write your own ERC-20 token
- Write an ICO contract
- Deploy to a testnet
- Write a frontend for investors to send ETH to a contract
â€‹
## Getting Started
â€‹
Use hardhat to create a new project, then write the following contracts.
â€‹
## The Acro Coin Token
â€‹
OpenZeppelin has a contract library for ERC-20. Use this library when creating your token.
â€‹
This token should have:
â€‹
- 500,000 max total supply                                                                                  ðŸ†—
- A 2% tax on every transfer that gets put into a treasury account                                          ðŸ†—
- A flag that toggles this tax on/off, controllable by owner, initialized to false                          ðŸ†—

## The ICO Contract
â€‹
Here's the spec:
â€‹
> The smart contract aims to raise 30,000 Ether by performing an ICO. 
> The ICO should only be available to whitelisted private investors starting in Phase Seed with a maximum total private contribution limit of 15,000 Ether and an individual contribution limit of 1,500 Ether.
> The ICO should become available to the general public during Phase General, with a total contribution limit equal to 30,000 Ether, inclusive of funds raised from the private phase.
> During this phase, the individual contribution limit should be 1,000 Ether, until Phase Open, at which point the individual contribution limit should be removed.
> At that point, the ICO contract should immediately release ERC20-compatible tokens for all contributors at an exchange rate of 5 tokens to 1 Ether.
> The owner of the contract should have the ability to pause and resume fundraising at any time, as well as move a phase forwards (but not backwards) at will.
â€‹
In practice, the "move a phase forwards" part is usually based on time rather than manual shifting. We have it this way for the purpose of the class.
â€‹
## Deployment
â€‹
Once you complete these contracts, deploy to the Rinkeby testnet https://hardhat.org/tutorial/deploying-to-a-live-network.html
â€‹
## The Frontend
â€‹
Your frontend should be a web page that:
â€‹
Displays how many tokens the user has purchased
Allows the user to deposit ETH into your ICO contract
Shows error messages when user makes an invalid request (i.e. attempting to deposit beyond the limit)
Do not worry about deploying your frontend. You can run it locally.
â€‹
You don't need to take care of design and details on frontend. It is the task to build smart contracts!
